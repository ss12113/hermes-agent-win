## Plugins

Hermes has two plugin surfaces. Both live under `plugins/` in the repo so
repo-shipped plugins can be discovered alongside user-installed ones in
`~/.hermes/plugins/` and pip-installed entry points.

### General plugins (`hermes_cli/plugins.py` + `plugins/<name>/`)

`PluginManager` discovers plugins from `~/.hermes/plugins/`, `./.hermes/plugins/`,
and pip entry points. Each plugin exposes a `register(ctx)` function that
can:

- Register Python-callback lifecycle hooks:
  `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`, `pre_llm_call`, `post_llm_call`,
  `on_session_start`, `on_session_end`
- Register new tools via `ctx.register_tool(...)`
- Register CLI subcommands via `ctx.register_cli_command(...)` — the
  plugin's argparse tree is wired into `hermes` at startup so
  `hermes <pluginname> <subcmd>` works with no change to `main.py`

Hooks are invoked from `model_tools.py` (pre/post tool) and `run_agent.py`
(lifecycle). **Discovery timing pitfall:** `discover_plugins()` only runs
as a side effect of importing `model_tools.py`. Code paths that read plugin
state without importing `model_tools.py` first must call `discover_plugins()`
explicitly (it's idempotent).

### Memory-provider plugins (`plugins/memory/<name>/`)

Separate discovery system for pluggable memory backends. Current built-in
providers include **honcho, mem0, supermemory, byterover, hindsight,
holographic, openviking, retaindb**.

Each provider implements the `MemoryProvider` ABC (see `agent/memory_provider.py`)
and is orchestrated by `agent/memory_manager.py`. Lifecycle hooks include
`sync_turn(turn_messages)`, `prefetch(query)`, `shutdown()`, and optional
`post_setup(hermes_home, config)` for setup-wizard integration.

**CLI commands via `plugins/memory/<name>/cli.py`:** if a memory plugin
defines `register_cli(subparser)`, `discover_plugin_cli_commands()` finds
it at argparse setup time and wires it into `hermes <plugin>`. The
framework only exposes CLI commands for the **currently active** memory
provider (read from `memory.provider` in config.yaml), so disabled
providers don't clutter `hermes --help`.

**Rule (Teknium, May 2026):** plugins MUST NOT modify core files
(`run_agent.py`, `cli.py`, `gateway/run.py`, `hermes_cli/main.py`, etc.).
If a plugin needs a capability the framework doesn't expose, expand the
generic plugin surface (new hook, new ctx method) — never hardcode
plugin-specific logic into core. PR #5295 removed 95 lines of hardcoded
honcho argparse from `main.py` for exactly this reason.

**No new in-tree memory providers (policy, May 2026):** the set of
built-in memory providers under `plugins/memory/` is closed. New memory
backends must ship as **standalone plugin repos** that users install
into `~/.hermes/plugins/` (or via pip entry points) — they implement
the same `MemoryProvider` ABC, register through the same discovery
path, and integrate via `hermes memory setup` / `post_setup()` without
landing in this tree. PRs that add a new directory under
`plugins/memory/` will be closed with a pointer to publish the
provider as its own repo. Existing in-tree providers stay; bug fixes
to them are welcome.

**No new third-party-product plugins in-tree (policy, June 2026):** the
same rule applies beyond memory providers. Plugins that integrate
someone else's product or project — observability/metrics backends,
vendor SaaS connectors, analytics dashboards, paid-service tie-ins —
must ship as **standalone plugin repos** that users install into
`~/.hermes/plugins/` (or via pip entry points). They register through
the existing plugin discovery path and use the ABCs/hooks/ctx surface
we expose; nothing special is needed in core. The reason is
maintenance load: every product we absorb into the tree becomes our
burden to keep working against a fast-moving core, for a backend we
don't own. Promote standalone plugins in the Nous Research Discord
(`#plugins-skills-and-skins`). PRs that add such a directory under
`plugins/` are closed with a pointer to publish it as its own repo —
this is a coupling decision, not a quality judgment. (The
`observability/`, `kanban/`, `disk-cleanup/`, etc. directories already
in the tree are existing precedent, not an invitation to add more
third-party-product plugins alongside them.)

### Model-provider plugins (`plugins/model-providers/<name>/`)

Every inference backend (openrouter, anthropic, gmi, deepseek, nvidia, …)
ships as a plugin here. Each plugin's `__init__.py` calls
`providers.register_provider(ProviderProfile(...))` at module load.
`providers/__init__.py._discover_providers()` is a **lazy, separate
discovery system** — scanned on first `get_provider_profile()` or
`list_providers()` call, NOT by the general PluginManager.

Scan order:
1. Bundled: `<repo>/plugins/model-providers/<name>/`
2. User: `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/model-providers/<name>/`
3. Legacy: `<repo>/providers/<name>.py` (back-compat)

User plugins of the same name override bundled ones — `register_provider()`
is last-writer-wins. This lets third parties swap out any built-in
profile without a repo patch.

The general PluginManager records `kind: model-provider` manifests but does
NOT import them (would double-instantiate `ProviderProfile`). Plugins
without an explicit `kind:` get auto-coerced via a source-text heuristic
(`register_provider` + `ProviderProfile` in `__init__.py`).

Full authoring guide: `website/docs/developer-guide/model-provider-plugin.md`.

### Dashboard / context-engine / image-gen plugin directories

`plugins/context_engine/`, `plugins/image_gen/`, etc. follow the same
pattern (ABC + orchestrator + per-plugin directory). Context engines
plug into `agent/context_engine.py`; image-gen providers into
`agent/image_gen_provider.py`. Reference / docs-companion plugins
(`example-dashboard`, `strike-freedom-cockpit`, `plugin-llm-example`,
`plugin-llm-async-example`) live in the
[`hermes-example-plugins`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-example-plugins)
companion repo, not in this tree.

## Surface capability is a property of the SESSION, never of the process env

A tool that works only because of *who is on the other end* (desktop panes, in-app browser,
message reactions, Projects) must resolve availability from the **session's own source**, not
from an env var on the backend. Client and backend are separate machines: the desktop app may
drive a locally spawned backend, one over SSH, one behind URL + token, or Hermes Cloud, and
only the first two carry `HERMES_DESKTOP=1`. An env-keyed gate is a silent no-op on the other
topologies — the tool is stripped from the schema while the platform hint tells the model it
is "inside the Hermes desktop app". The pattern:

- **The toolset is the surface gate.** Keep such tools off `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` and in a named
  toolset (`desktop_ui`, `project`); the GUI gateway's `_load_enabled_toolsets(platform)`
  folds it in when the session's platform says GUI. One resolver, every topology.
- **`check_fn` answers reachability or opt-in, not surface.** "Is the bridge wired?" — fine.
  "Was I spawned by Electron?" — not. `check_fn` results are TTL-cached process-wide
  (`tools/registry.py`); a per-session answer does not belong there.
- **Ask which identity you mean.** `HERMES_DESKTOP=1` legitimately means "this backend was
  spawned by the app" (cron ticker, web-dist handling). It does NOT mean "a GUI is watching";
  the embedded terminal pane (`hermes --tui` against that backend) is the counterexample.

Test: if the capability still makes sense with the client on another machine, it is
session-scoped. Assert the GUI session gets the tool **with the env var absent**.
