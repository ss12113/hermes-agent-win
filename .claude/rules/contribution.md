## Contribution Rubric — What We Want / What We Don't

This is the project's intent layer. Use it two ways:

1. **For humans and for your own work** — what gets merged and what gets
   rejected, so a contribution aims at the target.
2. **For automated review (the triage sweeper)** — guidance on when a PR is
   safe to close on the three allowed reasons (`implemented_on_main`,
   `cannot_reproduce`, `incoherent`) and, just as important, **when NOT to
   close** one. Taste-based "we don't want this / out of scope" closes are NOT
   an automated decision — those stay with a human maintainer. The sweeper's
   job here is to recognize design intent and *avoid wrongly closing a
   legitimate contribution*, not to make the won't-implement call itself.

Read the balance right: Hermes ships a **lot** — most merges are bug fixes to
real reported behavior, and the product surface (platforms, channels,
providers, models, desktop/TUI features) expands aggressively and on purpose.
The restraint below is aimed squarely at the **core agent + the model tool
schema**, the one place where every addition is paid for on every API call.
"Smallest footprint" governs *how a capability is wired into the core*, NOT
whether the product is allowed to grow. We are expansive at the edges and
conservative at the waist.

### What we want

- **Fix real bugs, well.** The bulk of what lands is `fix(...)` against an
  actual reported symptom. A good fix reproduces the symptom on current
  `main`, points to the exact line where it manifests, and fixes the whole bug
  class — sibling call paths included — not just the one site the reporter hit.
- **Expand reach at the edges.** New platform adapters, channels, providers,
  models, and desktop/TUI/dashboard features are welcome and land routinely,
  including large ones (a new messaging channel, a session-cap feature, a
  Windows PTY bridge). Breadth in the product is a goal, not a footprint
  concern — as long as it integrates with the existing setup/config UX
  (`hermes tools`, `hermes setup`, auto-install) rather than bolting on a raw
  env var.
- **Refactor god-files into clean modules.** Extracting a multi-thousand-line
  cluster out of `cli.py` / `run_agent.py` / `gateway/run.py` into a focused
  mixin or module is wanted work, even when the diff is huge and mechanical
  (large `+N/-N` refactors merge regularly). The "every line traces to the
  request" test applies to *feature* PRs; a declared refactor's request IS the
  extraction.
- **Keep the core narrow.** New *model tools* are the expensive exception —
  every tool ships on every API call. Prefer, in order: extend existing code →
  CLI command + skill → service-gated tool (`check_fn`) → plugin → MCP server
  in the catalog → new core tool (last resort). See "The Footprint Ladder."
- **Extend, don't duplicate.** Before adding a module/manager/hook, check
  whether existing infrastructure already covers the use case. When several PRs
  integrate the same *category*, design one shared interface instead of merging
  them one at a time (see the ABC + orchestrator note under the Footprint
  Ladder).
- **Behavior contracts over snapshots.** Tests should assert how two pieces of
  data must relate (invariants), not freeze a current value (model lists,
  config version literals, enumeration counts). See "Don't write
  change-detector tests."
- **E2E validation, not just green unit mocks.** For anything touching
  resolution chains, config propagation, security boundaries, remote
  backends, or file/network I/O, exercise the real path with real imports
  against a temp `HERMES_HOME`. Mocks hide integration bugs.
- **Cache-, alternation-, and invariant-safe.** Preserve prompt caching, strict
  message role alternation (never two same-role messages in a row; never a
  synthetic user message injected mid-loop), and a system prompt that is
  byte-stable for the life of a conversation.
- **Contributor credit preserved.** Salvage external work by cherry-picking
  (rebase-merge) so authorship survives in git history; don't reimplement from
  scratch when you can build on top.

### What we don't want (rejected even when well-built)

- **Speculative infrastructure.** Hooks, callbacks, or extension points with no
  concrete consumer. Adding a hook is easy; removing one after plugins depend
  on it is hard. A hook is NOT speculative if a contributor has a real, stated
  use case — even if the consumer ships separately.
- **New `HERMES_*` env vars for non-secret config.** `.env` is for secrets
  only (API keys, tokens, passwords). All behavioral settings — timeouts,
  thresholds, feature flags, display prefs — go in `config.yaml`. Bridge to an
  internal env var if the mechanism needs one, but user-facing docs point to
  `config.yaml`. Reject PRs that tell users to "set X in your .env" unless X
  is a credential.
- **A new core tool when terminal + file already do the job, or when a skill
  would.** If the only barrier is file visibility on a remote backend, fix the
  mount, not the toolset.
- **Lazy-reading escape hatches on instructional tools.** No `offset`/`limit`
  pagination on tools that load content the agent must read fully (skills,
  prompts, playbooks). Models will read page 1 and skip the rest.
- **"Fixes" that destroy the feature they secure.** A mitigation that kills the
  feature's purpose is the wrong mitigation. Read the original commit's intent
  (`git log -p -S`) before restricting behavior; find a fix that preserves the
  feature.
- **Outbound telemetry / usage attribution without opt-in gating.** No new
  analytics, third-party identifier tagging, or attribution tags until a
  generic user-facing opt-in (config gate + setup prompt + `hermes tools`
  toggle) exists. Park behind a label, do not merge.
- **Change-detector tests, cache-breaking mid-conversation, dead code wired in
  without E2E proof, and plugins that touch core files.** Plugins live in their
  own directory and work within the ABCs/hooks we provide; if a plugin needs
  more, widen the generic plugin surface, don't special-case it in core.
- **Third-party products / other people's projects integrated into the core
  tree.** Observability backends, vendor SaaS integrations, analytics dashboards,
  and similar "someone else's product" plugins do NOT land under `plugins/` in
  this repo. They place an ongoing maintenance burden on us to keep them working
  against a fast-moving core, for a backend we don't own. Ship them as a
  **standalone plugin repo** users install into `~/.hermes/plugins/` (or via a
  pip entry point), and promote them in the Nous Research Discord
  (`#plugins-skills-and-skins`). This is a coupling-and-maintenance decision, not
  a quality bar — the plugin can be excellent and still be a close. PRs that add
  such a directory to the tree are closed with a pointer to publish it as its own
  repo.

### Before you call it a bug — verify the premise (and when NOT to close)

The most common reason a well-written PR gets closed is not code quality — it
is that the change is built on a **wrong premise**, or it treats an
**intentional design as a gap**. These patterns cut both ways: they tell a
human reviewer what to scrutinize, and they tell the automated sweeper when a
PR is NOT safe to close as `implemented_on_main` / `cannot_reproduce` (when in
doubt, leave it open for a human). They are distilled from real closes.

- **"Intentional design, not a gap."** A limitation that looks like an
  oversight is often deliberate. Before "fixing" a missing link or a
  restriction, ask whether the isolation IS the design. Example: profiles are
  independent islands on purpose — a PR adding live config inheritance from the
  default profile was closed because coupling profiles together is exactly what
  the design prevents (the copy-at-creation `--clone` path already covers the
  legitimate "start from my default" case). Read the original commit's intent
  (`git log -p -S "<symbol>"`) before assuming something is unfinished.
- **"The premise doesn't hold against how X actually works."** A PR's
  justification frequently rests on a wrong mental model of an existing
  mechanism. Trace the real code/runtime before accepting the rationale. Two
  real closes: a rate-limit "re-probe during cooldown" PR (the breaker only
  trips on a *confirmed-empty* account bucket, so re-probing just hammers a
  bucket we've already proven empty); a usage-accumulation fix whose new branch
  **never executes at runtime** because an earlier guard already popped the
  state it depended on. If you can't point to the exact line where the bug
  manifests AND show the fix changes that line's behavior, you haven't verified
  the premise.
- **"This fix was wrong — the absence/omission was deliberate."** Adding the
  obvious-looking missing piece can break things the omission was protecting.
  Example: restoring "missing" `__init__.py` files made a test tree importable
  as a dotted package that shadowed the real plugin, deleting its `register()`
  at import time. The absence was load-bearing.
- **"Overreached / resurrected an approach we'd moved past."** Scope creep that
  supersedes an agreed-on base, or revives a direction the maintainers
  deliberately closed, gets rejected even when the code works. Keep the change
  to the narrow piece that was actually agreed; offer the rest as a focused
  follow-up.

The throughline: **verify the claim AND the intent against the codebase before
writing or merging a fix.** A confirmed reproduction on current `main` plus a
line-level account of where the fix acts beats a plausible-sounding rationale
every time. When in doubt about intent, it is cheaper to ask than to ship a
fix that fights the design.

### The Footprint Ladder (new capability decision)

Each rung adds more permanent surface than the one above. Choose the highest
(least-footprint) rung that correctly solves the problem:

1. **Extend existing code** — the capability is a variation of something that
   already exists. Zero new surface.
2. **CLI command + skill** — manages config/state/infra expressible as shell
   commands. The agent runs `hermes <subcommand>` guided by a skill. Zero
   model-tool footprint. Default choice for subscriptions, scheduled tasks,
   service setup. Examples: `hermes webhook`, `hermes cron`, `hermes tools`.
3. **Service-gated tool (`check_fn`)** — needs structured params/returns AND
   only appears when a prerequisite is configured. Zero footprint otherwise.
   Examples: Home Assistant tools (gated on token), memory-provider tools.
4. **Plugin** — third-party/niche/user-specific capability that doesn't ship in
   core. Lives in `~/.hermes/plugins/` or a pip package, discovered at runtime.
5. **MCP server (in the catalog)** — if the capability genuinely needs to be a
   tool (structured I/O the agent invokes) but isn't core-fundamental, prefer
   building it as an MCP server and adding it to the MCP catalog over growing
   the core toolset. The agent connects to it through the built-in MCP client;
   zero permanent core-schema footprint, and it's reusable by any MCP host.
6. **New core tool** — only when the capability is fundamental, broadly useful
   to nearly every user, and unreachable via terminal + file (or an MCP server).
   Examples of correct core tools: terminal, read_file, web_search,
   browser_navigate.

When 3+ open PRs try to integrate the same *category* of thing (memory
backends, providers, notifiers), don't merge them one at a time — design an
ABC + orchestrator, wrap the existing built-in as the first provider, and turn
the competing PRs into plugins against that interface.
