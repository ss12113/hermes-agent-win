## Delegation (`delegate_task`)

`tools/delegate_tool.py` spawns a subagent with an isolated
context + terminal session. By default the parent waits for the
child's summary before continuing its own loop. With `background=true`,
Hermes returns a delegation id immediately and the result re-enters the
conversation later through the async-delegation completion queue.

Two shapes:

- **Single:** pass `goal` (+ optional `context`, `toolsets`).
- **Batch (parallel):** pass `tasks: [...]` — each gets its own subagent
  running concurrently. Concurrency is capped by
  `delegation.max_concurrent_children` (default 3).

Roles:

- `role="leaf"` (default) — focused worker. Cannot call `delegate_task`,
  `clarify`, `memory`, `send_message`, `execute_code`.
- `role="orchestrator"` — retains `delegate_task` so it can spawn its
  own workers. Gated by `delegation.orchestrator_enabled` (default true)
  and bounded by `delegation.max_spawn_depth` (default 2).

Key config knobs (under `delegation:` in `config.yaml`):
`max_concurrent_children`, `max_spawn_depth`, `child_timeout_seconds`,
`orchestrator_enabled`, `subagent_auto_approve`, `inherit_mcp_toolsets`,
`max_iterations`.

Durability rule: background `delegate_task` is detached from the current
turn but still process-local. For work that must survive process restart, use
`cronjob` or `terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)` instead.
